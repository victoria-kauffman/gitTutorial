It was a nice day.
All the days had been nice. There had been rather more than seven of them so far, and rain hadn't
been invented yet. But clouds massing east of Eden suggested that the first thunderstorm was on its way,
and it was going to be a big one.
The angel of the Eastern Gate put his wings over his head to shield himself from the first drops.
"I'm sorry," he said politely. "What was it you were saying?"
"I said, that one went down like a lead balloon," said the serpent. 
Oh. Yes," said the angel, whose name was Aziraphale.
"I think it was a bit of an overreaction, to be honest," said the serpent. "I mean, first offense and
everything. I can't see what's so bad about knowing the difference between good and evil, anyway." 
And then the rainstorm came.
